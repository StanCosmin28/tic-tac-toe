# React + Vite

Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This is one of my early React projects, showcasing core web development fundamentals. Deployed live using GitHub Pages, marking a fun learning experience in deploying React apps with Vite.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
